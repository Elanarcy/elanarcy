### Hi there 👋

<!--
**Elanarcy/elanarcy** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

👨🏻‍💻 About Me:
🔭 I’m currently working on node running and testnets
🌱 I’m currently learning from A to Z with Docker
👯 I’m looking to collaborate with other content creators
⚡ Projects I participated in and contributed to:
Celestia (Mamaki Testnet), Dymension RollApp, Aptos, Sui, Sei, Humanode.

... new ones will be added continuously

Nodes 💦
I utilize cloud providers such as OVH for my Nodes & projects, meticulously choosing them based on location and hardware criteria.
